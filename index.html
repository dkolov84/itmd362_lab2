<!-- ITMD 362, Lab 2: Form Semantics and Normalized Styles
In the `index.html` file in this directory, create a form that asks for
a user’s email address, phone number, and date of birth. There should also be a submit button.

Be sure to:
* Use the best HTML `<input>` types
* Use additional HTML `<input>` attributes to present mobile keyboards suited to the input task
* Use semantically associated `<label>` tags
* Use some kind of semantic grouping structure in HTML to keep labels and inputs together

Then, in the `screen.css` file, do the following:
* Open with a rich set of reset CSS styles (such as Eric Meyer’s used in class demos)
* Include a set of normalization styles for your forms (such as the Form area of Normalize.css)
* Use CSS to stylize the form between a scroll friendly mobile first, and a sectioned desktop version. 

As with all labs, be sure that you are doing multiple, granular/atomic commits as you
complete your work.
